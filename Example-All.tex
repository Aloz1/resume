    \careerobjective{a software engineering opportunity complete my degree}{%
        Through my degree, I have gained knowledge in several areas, including embedded systems programming (bare metal, RTOS, embedded Linux), general programming practices and idioms, signal processing, basic analog and digital circuit design theory.
        My prior work place has given me a large amount of experience with Linux, virtualized environments, network infrastructure, and general systems maintenance.
        Finally, having spent time with the Swinburne Cyber Security Club, and participating in a number of CTF's (including CySCA 2017 \& 2018), I feel I have a unique perspective on problem solving.}
