    \cventry{2019}{IoT Vehicle tracking system}{}{}{\hfill\httpslink{github.com/Aloz1/iot-report}}{
        A proof of concept IoT vehicle tracking system with wireless BLE nodes and cloud data storage.
        \vskip .5em
        \begin{compactitem}
            \item Includes an ESP32 based GPS node and an Arduino based IMU node with BLE GATT communications to an edge device (raspberry pi).
            \item Edge device utilises Redis data caching, for intermittent internet connectivity.
            \item Communications between edge and cloud is via MQTT, with data stored in DynamoDB.
            \item Firmware for nodes written in C++, edge services written in Python, web client uses a combination of Python, javascript and HTML, the report is written in \LaTeX.
