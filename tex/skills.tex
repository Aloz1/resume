%      outcome.
%
% * Customer Focus:
%      How well I get to know a team, department, client or prospect. How I empathise with

% * Planning and Organisation:
%      Where I've needed to structure and prioritise activities or tasks. A skill that people
%      often make great use of outside of the office, especially with children. Describe how
%      I've broken an activity down into manageable and measurable parts.
%
% * Self-management:
%      Employers looking for people that demonstrate initiative, resourcefulness, focus,
%      self-reliance and motivation. Show evidence of where I've set myself a goal and
%      achieved it, or where I've taken control of my own learning. Also important that I
%      display integrity and professionalism.
%
% Note: Don't need all 8, but employers will expect me to articulate experiences in relation
%       to two or three skills they really need.
%
% My resume should ideally have examples of 4 of the above skills.
